The new version focused on supporting older browsers (and PSVita) with new features is in the works.
However, it is still not done and will not be released in a while.
If you want a light client with features, I recommend you to take a look at Reduct's fork, <a href="https://error-404-null-not-found.github.io/Retaped/">Retaped</a>
However, if you want to experience a real client held together by duct tape and bad code, look <a href="/Reduct/legacy.html">HERE</a>
It might not see as many new updates as the new version and it will sure not get all of the features you would expect from a chat client (that's what the new version is for), but it still will have some,
so it at least keeps working
