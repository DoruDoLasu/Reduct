<p>The new version focused on supporting older browsers (and PSVita) with new features is here, RIGHT HERE.</p>

        <h1><a href="/Reduct/next.html">RIGHT HERE</a></h1>
        
<p>However, if you want to experience a real client held together by duct tape and bad code, look <a href="/Reduct/classic.html">HERE</a></p>
<p>It might not see as many new updates as the new version and it will sure not get all of the features you would expect from a chat client (that's what the new version is for), but it still will have some,
so it at least keeps working</p>
